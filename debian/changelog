usrmerge (35) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Partially revert and further change the fix for #1024596, because it
    was incomplete and would fail when the directory containing the RTLD
    (e.g. /lib64) did not exist in /usr. (Closes: #1025926)

 -- Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it>  Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:36:05 +0100

usrmerge (34) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Stopped creating the empty biarch directories, because glibc >= 2.35-4
    does that in preinst. (Closes: #1024596)
  * preinst: use mountpoint(1) to check if /usr is standalone instead
    if comparing st_dev, because this does not work with BTRFS subvolumes.
    (Closes: #1023816)
  * Updated the versioned conflict with kbd. (Closes: #1022936)
  * Made debian/copyright machine-readable. (Closes: #1025684)

  * Implemented only for Hurd systems a modified algorithm provided by
    Samuel Thibault. (Closes: #1020463)

  * convert-usrmerge: fix handling the link X directory case.
    The case in which the source and destination are a symlink and a
    directory (or a directory and a symlink) actually was never handled.
    (Closes: #1020312)
  * Updated the versioned conflict with libpng12-0. (Closes: #1020549)
  * Relabel for SELinux the newly created directories and /etc/shells,

    the system does not have a merged /usr. (See the TC decision #994388.)
  * Implemented a flag file to skip the conversion, for the benefit of
    buildds. (Closes: #1008203)
  * Made postinst always fail if the conversion is not possible.
  * Made postinst fail if overlayfs is involved. (Closes: #1008202)

    request of Ubuntu. (Closes: #997866)
  * Conflict with cruft. (Closes: #1002888)
